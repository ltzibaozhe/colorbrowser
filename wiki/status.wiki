#summary The current status of the application

I've got plans for the Color Browser, but at the moment there are two ways to add a new color (note that the "New" button is not yet functional).  You can copy the "Hex:..." line from the bottom of a Kuler RSS feed, or you can drag and drop a CSS file from ColourLovers onto the application.

I've just added the ability to edit the colors in a set by changing the hex value.  Unfortunately it still doesn't let you save the values back.  It's getting there though.  Once you can create/edit sets completely using the hex values I'm going to move on to finding a suitable color picker to use for editing that way.

== Future Plans ==
These are the items I'd like to add to the app as I go.
  * Ability to import and export ASE (Adobe Stock Exchange) files.
  * Ability to create your own schemes and save them (This is partially implemented).
  * Closely related to the last point, I'd like to be able to edit sets that are already included.  (Note that duplication is already available, but it's not really useful yet.)
  * View a single set in the application (remove the distractions of the other sets).
  * More as I think of them ...
